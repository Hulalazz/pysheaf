PySheaf master tasks list:
=====

1. Implement maximal local sections algorithm as a method in Sheaf.  See

2. Finish implementing and testing local homology for cell complexes:
 a. CellComplex.inducedMapLocalHomology()
 b. Clean up CellComplex.localPairComplex()

3. Rebuild unit tests using the Python unittest module

4. Finish implementing and testing AmbiguitySheaf

5. Replace list semantics throughout with dictionaries.  Especially where random accesses are important, for instance in
 a. CellComplex
 b. Sheaf

6. Generalize inducedMap to handle categories other than finite dimensional vector spaces
